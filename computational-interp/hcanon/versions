HSetLang  -- language definition
HSetProof2 -- main proof

HSetProof -- before adding the action on maps to R_pi
HSetProof3 -- try binary definition of Q_Pi
              ap for application seems better, but still requires some massaging.

                                         basic definitions go through, but transport_Pi
                                         doesn't seem to work.  

HSetLang-Telescope/HSetProof-Telescope -- first attempt, using decoding functions.
                                       gets into trouble because Agda won't split
