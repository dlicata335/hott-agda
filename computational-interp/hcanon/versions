HSetLang  -- language definition

scraps/HSetProof-beforeRPi -- before adding the action on maps to R_pi
HSetProof-binaryQPi -- try binary definition of Q_Pi
                       ap for application seems better, but still requires some massaging.

                                          basic definitions go through, but transport_Pi
                                          doesn't seem to work.  

scraps/HSetLang-Telescope-decode
scraps/HSetProof-Telescope-decode -- first attempt, using decoding functions.
                                     gets into trouble because Agda won't split
