 a bunch of stuff using an older version of lib/
 some of this needs to be resuccitated

lib
  basic constructions of homotopy type theory

applications
  applications of homotopy type theory to proving/formalizing/reasoning
  Currently includes:
  (1) a proof that higher fundamental groups are abelian

misc
  miscellaneous little experiments
  Currently includes:
  (1) a proof that set extensionality (univalence) implies functional extensionality
  (2) a start at a translation of Voevodsky's basic definitions into Agda
  (3) working out the contradiction between univalence and UIP
