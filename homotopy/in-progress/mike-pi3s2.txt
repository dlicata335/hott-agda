Here's something else to think about: Omega^3(S^2) = Omega^3(S^3).
Once we have the Hopf fibration with total space S^3, this ought to
follow from general facts about fiber sequences and the fact that
Omega^2(S^1) is contractible.  Can we prove it directly with
type-theoretic methods?  Of course, this would give us much more
information than pi_3(S^2)=Z.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Classically, connected pointed homotopy 2-types are determined
uniquely up to equivalence by:

- a group π1
- an abelian group π2
- an action of π1 on π2
- an element of group cohomology H^3(π1;π2) (the "k-invariant")

For the 2-type of a loop space, π1 is also going to be abelian, and
for the same reasons the action of π1 on π2 is going to be trivial.  I
don't know whether the k-invariant is also trivial; I'm trying to
track down some algebraic topology in this direction.  So far I've
found that if we had the 2-type of a *double* loop space, then it
would be trivial, but I'm not sure about a single loop space yet.
(Confusingly, there is also a different k-invariant that lives in
"abelian group cohomology" which needs to be incorporated if you want
to determine the loop-space structure as well.)

If the k-invariant of Omega(S^2) is trivial, then I think your
proposal for X ought to do it.  If not, then I think we'd need
something fancier.

Interestingly, if the latter is the case, then calculating π4(S^3)
might actually be easier, since in that case the k-invariant is
trivial.  (If so, it would be the first appearance in homotopy type
theory of the classically well-known fact that calculations are easier
to do stably than unstably.)  For Omega^2(S^3) we have

π0 = unit
π1 = Z
π2 = Z/2

and so perhaps we could use an X generated by

base  : X
loop  : base = base
loop2 : id_id{base} = id_id{base}
loop2order2 : loop2 @ loop2 = id_(id_id{base})

Admittedly, with a 3-cell constructor this might be getting beyond the
range of feasibility.  (-:
