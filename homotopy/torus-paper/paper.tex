\begin{abstract}
Homotopy theory can be developed synthetically in homotopy type theory,
using types to describe constructions on spaces.  The identity type has
a central role: an element of the identity type is regarded as a path in
a space, and iterated identity types describe higher-dimensional paths.
While some calculations, constructions, and theorems of homotopy theory
have been developed synthetically and formalized in proof assistants,
some seemingly straightforward examples have proved difficult because
the required manipulations of paths and higher-dimensional paths becomes
complicated.  In this paper, we describe a cubical approach to
developing homotopy theory within type theory.  One ingredient of this
approach is to complement the identity type, which relates two elements
of one type, with higher-dimensional cube types.  For example, we
consider a type of squares, which is dependent on the boundary of a
square (four points and four lines), and a type of three-dimensional
cubes, which is dependent on the boundary of a cube.  Another ingredient
is \emph{path-over-a-path} types and higher generalizations, which
describe paths in fibrations that lay over a path in the base.  These
higher-dimensional cube and path-over types can be defined in terms of
the usual identity type, but isolating them as independent conceptual
abstractions has allowed for the formalization of some previously
difficult examples, such as a proof that the torus is the product of two
circles, and a proof of a three-by-three lemma about pushouts that is
used in the calculation of the total space of the Hopf fibration.
