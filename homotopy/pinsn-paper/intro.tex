\section{Introduction}

Homotopy type theory~\citep{...} is an extension of Martin-L\"of's
intensional type theory with new principles such as Voevodsky's
univalence axiom~\citep{...} and higher-dimensional inductive
types~\citep{...}.  These extensions are interesting both from a
computer science perspective, where they imbue the equality apparatus of
type theory with new computational meaning, and from a mathematical
perspective, where they allow higher-dimensional mathematics to be
expressed cleanly and elegantly in type theory.  One example of
higher-dimensional mathematics is the subject of homotopy theory, a
branch of algebraic topology.  In homotopy theory, one studies
topological spaces by way of their points, paths between points,
\emph{homotopies}, or paths between paths, and then homotopies between
homotopies, and so on.  This infinite tower of concepts---spaces,
points, paths, homotopies, and so on---is modeled in type theory by
types, elements of types, proofs of equality of elements, proofs of
equality of proofs of equality, and so on.  A space corresponds to a
type $A$. Points of a space correspond to elements $a,b : A$. Paths in a
space elements of the identity type (propositional equality), which we
notate $p : a =_A b$.  Homotopies between paths $p$ and $q$ correspond
to elements of the iterated identity type $p =_{a =_A b} q$.  The
general equality apparatus of type theory allows one to define all of
the operations and properties of paths.  These include identity paths
$\dsd{id} : a = a$ (reflexivity of equality), inverse paths $\inv p : b
= a$ when $p : a = b$ (symmetry of equality), and composition of paths
$q \comp p : a = c$ when $p : a = b$ and $q : b = c$ (transitivity of
equality), as well as homotopies relating these operations (for example,
$id \comp p = p$), and homotopies relating these homotopies, etc.  This
equips each type with the structure of a (weak)
\emph{$\infty$-groupoid}, as studied in higher category
theory~\citep{...}.  In category theoretic terminology, the elements of
a type correspond to objects (or 0-cells), the proofs of equality of
elements to morphisms (1-cells), the proofs of equality of proofs of
equality to 2-morphisms (2-cells), and so on.

One basic question in algebraic topology is calculating the
\emph{homotopy groups} of a space.  Given a space $X$ with a
distinguished point $x_0$, $\pi_1(X,x_0)$, the \emph{fundamental group},
is the group of loops at $x_0$, with composition as the group operation.
The fundamental group is the first in a sequence of \emph{homotopy
  groups}, which provide higher-dimensional information about a space:
the homotopy groups $\pi_n(X,x_0)$ ``count'' the $n$-dimensional loops in 
that space.  $\pi_2(X,x_0)$ is the group of homotopies between
$\dsd{id}_{{x_0}}$ and itself, $\pi_3(X,x_0)$ is the group of homotopies
between $\dsd{id}_{\dsd{id}_{{x_0}}}$ and itself, and so on.
\emph{Calculating a homotopy group} means proving a group isomorphism
between $\pi_n$ of a space and some explicit description of a group,
such as \Z\/ or $\Z_k$ (\Z\/ mod $k$).  

The homotopy groups of a space can be difficult to calculate.  This is
true even for spaces as simple as the $n$-dimensional spheres (the
circle, the sphere, \ldots)---some homotopy groups of spheres are
currently unknown.  A category-theoretic explanation for this fact is
the spheres (up to homotopy) can be presented as \emph{free
  $\infty$-groupoids} constructed by certain generators, and it can be
difficult to relate a presentation of a space as a free
$\infty$-groupoid to an explicit description of its homotopy groups.
For example, the circle is the free $\infty$-groupoids with one point
and one loop:

[fig]

\dsd{base} is a point (object) on the circle, and \dsd{loop} is a path
(morphism) from \dsd{base} to itself.  That the circle is the free
$\infty$-groupoid on these generators means that all the points, paths,
homotopies, \ldots on the circle are constructed by applying the
$\infty$-groupoid operations to these generators.  The generator
\dsd{loop} represents ``going around the circle once
counter-clockwise.''  Using the groupoid operations, one can construct
additional paths, such as $\inv {\dsd{loop}}$ (going around the circle once
clockwise) and $\dsd{loop} \comp \dsd{loop}$ (going around the circle
twice counter-clockwise).  Moreover, there are homotopies between paths,
such as $\dsd{loop} \comp \inv {\dsd{loop}} = \dsd{id}$ (going clockwise and
then counter-clockwise is the same, up to homotopy, as not going
anywhere at all).  In this case, one can calculate that, up to homotopy,
all loops on the circle are either \dsd{id} or $(\dsd{loop} \comp
\dsd{loop} \ldots \comp \dsd{loop})$ ($n$ times, for any $n$) or $(\inv{
\dsd{loop}} \comp \inv{  \dsd{loop}} \ldots \comp \inv{ \dsd{loop}})$ ($n$ times,
for any $n$), and thus that the loops on the circle are in
correspondence with the integers.  Thus, the fundamental group of the
circle is \Z.

However, in general, it can be quite difficult to relate a presentation
of a space as a free $\infty$-groupoid to an explicit description of its
homotopy groups, in part because of \emph{action across levels}.  For
example, the sphere can be presented as the free $\infty$-groupoid with
one point (0-cell) \dsd{base} and one homotopy (2-cell) $\dsd{loop}_2$
between $\dsd{id}_{{\dsd{base}}}$ (the path that stands still at
\dsd{base}) and itself---think of $\dsd{loop}_2$ as ``going around the
the surface of the sphere.''  An $\infty$-groupoid has group operations
at each level, so just as we have identity, inverse, and composition
operations on paths (1-cells), we have identity, inverse, and
composition operations on homotopies (2-cells).  Thus, we can form
homotopies such as \dsd{loop_2} \comp \dsd{loop_2} (going around the
surface of the sphere twice) and \dsd{loop_2} \comp \inv{\dsd{loop_2}}
(going around the surface of the sphere once in one direction, and then
in the opposite direction)---and, analgously to above, there is a
homotopy-between-homotopies relating the latter path to the constant
homotopy ($\dsd{loop_2} \comp \inv{\dsd{loop_2}} =
\dsd{id}_{{\dsd{id}_{\dsd{base}}}}$).  Thus, one would expect that the
homotopies (2-cells) on the sphere have the same structure as the paths
(1-cells) on the circle, and this is indeed the case: $\pi_2(S^2)$ is
also \Z.  However, $\infty$-groupoids have more structure than just the
group operations at each level---for example, lower-dimensional
generators can construct higher-dimensional paths.  An example of this
is that $\pi_3(S^2)$, the group of homotopies between homotopies
(3-cells) on the sphere, is also \Z, \emph{despite the fact that there
  are no generators for 3-cells in the presentation of the sphere!}  The
paths arise from the applying the algebraic operations of a
$\infty$-groupoid to the 2-cell generator $\dsd{loop_2}$---and this
action across levels is one reason that homotopy groups are so difficult
to calculate.  

One enticing idea is to use homotopy type theory to calculate homotopy
groups: by doing so, we can give computer-checked proofs of these
calculations, and we can potentially exploit constructivity and the
type-theoretic perspective $\infty$-groupoids to attack these difficult
problems in algebraic topology.  Fortunately, it is simple to pose the
problem of calculating a homotopy group in homotopy type theory.  First,
we describe a space using \emph{higher inductive types}, which
generalize ordinary inductive types by allowing constructors not only
for elements of the type, but for paths (proofs of equality).  For
example, the circle is represented by a higher inductive type with two
constructors

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\dsd{base} : S^1 \\
\dsd{loop} : \dsd{base} =_{S^1} \dsd{base} \\
\end{array}
\]

This says that \dsd{base} is a point on the circle, while \dsd{loop} is
a path from \dsd{base} to \dsd{base}.
